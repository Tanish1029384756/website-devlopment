            <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known astronomical object to harbor life, serving as the home to
            millions of species. It is a terrestrial planet, primarily composed of rock and metal, with 70.8% of its surface covered
            by liquid water. Formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago, it has a dynamic, layered structure, a protective
            atmosphere, and a single natural satellite, the Moon.</p>
